# AI-Powered Question Answering Assistant with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

## Overview

This project focuses on developing an AI-powered Question Answering (QA) assistant using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to enhance its capabilities. The RAG model leverages both a knowledge base and generative model to provide accurate, contextually relevant answers in real-time.

## Project Structure

- **Data Preparation:** The project utilizes the SANAD dataset, a text dataset organized into various categories. The data is processed and structured for use in the RAG model.
- **Model Implementation:** The project implements a RAG model, integrating a retrieval mechanism to fetch relevant documents and a generative model to answer questions based on the retrieved content.
- **Deployment:** The QA assistant is deployed and tested, offering real-time interactions and accurate responses.

## Dataset

The SANAD dataset is used in this project and includes text data categorized by themes or topics. Key attributes include:
- `category`: The theme or topic associated with the text.
- `Content`: The text content used for training the RAG model.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo-name/rag-qa-assistant.git
   cd rag-qa-assistant
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed. Then, install the required libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Download the dataset:**

   Place the SANAD dataset in the appropriate directory (e.g., `./text-data/`). The dataset can be downloaded from [this link](https://www.kaggle.com/haithemhermessi/sanad-dataset).

4. **Run the notebook:**

   Explore the project step-by-step by running the provided Jupyter notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook RAG.ipynb
   ```

## Usage

- **Data Preparation:** The notebook provides instructions on how to download and prepare the SANAD dataset for use in the RAG model.
- **Model Training:** The RAG model is trained using the prepared data. You can customize the retrieval and generation components according to your requirements.
- **Deployment:** The model is deployed and tested, providing a user interface for real-time QA interactions.

## Results

The results include:
- **Document Retrieval Accuracy:** Evaluation of the modelâ€™s ability to retrieve the most relevant documents from the knowledge base.
- **Generative Model Coherence:** Assessment of the generated responses' relevance and coherence based on the retrieved documents.
- **Real-Time Interaction:** The QA assistant's performance in real-time interaction scenarios.
